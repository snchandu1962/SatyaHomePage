## Kickoff
With your guidance, I'd like to build a personal homepage using HTML and CSS.
Please note that I'll only request specific code snippets as we progress,
so there's no need to provide code until I explicitly ask for it.
Are you ready to start?

## HTML Structure
Help me design a basic HTML structure for a personal homepage.
It should have the following sections: a header, a section for 
displaying my projects, an about section, and a section for
showcasing my skills. Also, include a footer.

Please add these sections as placeholders for now, as we will be coding 
them and filling them out step by step.

## Header and Navigation
Please code an HTML header displaying my name, "Guil H," and navigation
links for the sections: projects, about, and skills.

## About Section
Now guide me to create the HTML for the about section. It should include
my picture, a friendly introduction, and a link to my resume.

## Skills Section
Now let's code the HTML for my skills section. 

Letâ€™s start with the skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript. 
Each skill should have a name and a description. I also want to display
a progress bar representing my proficiency in each skill.

## Footer
Create the HTML for the page footer. It should contain copyright information
and links to my LinkedIn, Twitter, and Instagram profiles. Please use
icon fonts to display a social media icon for each link.

## CSS Layout and Design
Next, design a simple modern CSS layout for my homepage. 
The layout should be responsive to different screen sizes using CSS media queries.

I prefer a black-and-white color scheme and sans-serif fonts. 

Make my picture smaller and rounded. Please add generous line height
and visual space around the content.



#Projects Section:
# Challenge: Add your project slideshow
#        * Place in the HTML in the projects section
#        * Add the slideshow's CSS to slideshow.css
#        * Include the JavaScript in script.js
